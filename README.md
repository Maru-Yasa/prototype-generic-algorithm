## Genetic Algorithm
In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research"), a **genetic algorithm** (**GA**) is a [metaheuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic "Metaheuristic") inspired by the process of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection") that belongs to the larger class of [evolutionary algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm "Evolutionary algorithm") (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics) "Optimization (mathematics)") and [search problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm "Search algorithm") by relying on biologically inspired operators such as [mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm) "Mutation (genetic algorithm)"), [crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm) "Crossover (genetic algorithm)") and [selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(genetic_algorithm) "Selection (genetic algorithm)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMitchell19962-1) Some examples of GA applications include optimizing [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning "Decision tree learning") for better performance, solving [sudoku puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms "Sudoku solving algorithms"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm#cite_note-2)  [hyperparameter optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization "Hyperparameter optimization"), etc.
